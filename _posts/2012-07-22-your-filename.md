# First post using Prose and GitHub

I have been following the tutorial from the [Prose.io](http://prose.io/help/getting-started.html) website.

One slight issue I had was that the didn't realize that I needed to clear the CNAME after forking Prose/boostrap. Just a heads-up for others out there trying to do similarly.
